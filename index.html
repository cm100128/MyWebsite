<p>Stardew Valley is a calm game where the player(s) have to make a living by farming, fishing, mining, foraging and more, doing so while making friendships in Pelican town. It was realeased by ConcernedApe on Febuary 16th, 2016. The game initially starts off with the player(s) escaping their old office job, and they move to Pelican town in the Valley. They soon learn to love it, while growing their farm. As the farmer soon discovers more secrets in the Valley, their levels increase and items can be gained.    </p>

    <p>There are 45 characters in Stardew Valley, each having different personalities, likes , dislikes and backstories. The main characters at the start of the game are the people who live in Pelican Town, but the farmer begins to meet more characters later on in the game. The farmer has the choice to marry one of the Bacherors or Bachelorettes by building friendship by giving them gifts and watching special heart events or cutscenes.</p>

         <p>The game works with a joystick and buttons, or touchscreen, a keyboard and mouse, and much more. Technically, the game never ends, its lead completely by the player(s). Farmers can decorate and design their farm as much and how they like it. </p>

     <p>Friendship is very important in Stardew Valley, as friends are obviously nice, but also useful. The Farmer has to complete the Community Center, an old building taken over by the forest restored with special items, and friends can send the Farmer useful items in the mail. And as said before, by giving liked or loved gifts to people, you can watch special cutscenes or heart events, and with enough hearts, you can date and/or marry one of the bachelor/bachelorettes. But if you give them disliked or hated gifts, friendship will be low with the specific characters you give the gifts to. There are no negative cutscenes, but your "hearts" will be low.
